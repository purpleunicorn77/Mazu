    <h1>Chapter 4 Belief in Mazu</h1>
    <p>In the 1970s, Taiwan experienced rapid economic growth, leading local people to undertake large-scale rebuilding and expansion of temples. As a result, the number of Mazu temples surged to over 3,000. Mazu is considered a central figure in Taiwanese folk belief, with events like the Mazu Pilgrimage further deepening the devotion to this tradition.</p>
